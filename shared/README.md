# shared

Internal monorepo package: Zod schemas and types shared by the **backend** (Nest) and **front** (Next).

## Structure

- `src/schemas/` — source (`.ts`)
- `dist/` — compiled output (`.js` + `.d.ts`), generated by `npm run build`

## Usage

1. **Build** (whenever you change something here):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Backend and front import via the `@shared/*` alias, which points at `dist/*`.

## Development

After changing files in `src/`, run `npm run build` in this package before building or running the backend or front.
